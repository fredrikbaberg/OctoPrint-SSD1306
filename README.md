# SSD1306 OLED Display

This plugin utilizes a 128x32 SSD1306-based display to display printer and job status for OctoPrint.  It provides a convenient way to view job status directly on the Raspberry Pi without needing to open a web page, for printers that either don't have a display or won't respond to commands to update their display.

This has been re-written from the forked repository. It's written for a 128x32 display and adapted to Python 3.

## Setup
